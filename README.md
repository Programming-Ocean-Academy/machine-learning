##  Overview

`scikitelearn-collections` is a curated collection of robust utilities, transformers, wrappers, and experiment tools built on top of the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) ecosystem. It helps you streamline model development, experiment tracking, and pipeline customization — all with full Scikit-learn compatibility.

---

##  Features

-  Plug-and-play `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` components  
-  Drop-in **feature generators** (dates, text, outliers, etc.)  
-  Advanced custom **transformers** and **meta-estimators**  
-  Support for **nested cross-validation** and custom scorers  
-  Compatible with `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`  
-  Simple **model evaluation** wrappers with logging  
-  Utility functions for **feature selection**, **data cleaning**, and **split strategies**  
-  Modular design for **experimentation & reproducibility**  
-  Clean, tested, and production-grade Python code  
-  100% compatible with Scikit-learn’s API & best practices  

---

##  Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- scikit-learn >= 1.0  
- numpy, pandas, joblib  

### Install via pip (PyPI release coming soon)

```bash
pip install scikitelearn-collections
````

Until then, you can clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scikitelearn-collections.git
cd scikitelearn-collections
pip install -e .
```

---

##  Quick Start

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from scikitelearn_collections.transformers import DateFeatureGenerator, OutlierRemover
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("date_features", DateFeatureGenerator(columns=["signup_date"])),
    ("remove_outliers", OutlierRemover(method="zscore", threshold=3.0)),
    ("classifier", LogisticRegression())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
