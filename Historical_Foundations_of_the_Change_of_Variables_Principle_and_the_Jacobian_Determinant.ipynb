        "\n",
        "### Contribution\n",
        "Lagrange laid some of the earliest conceptual foundations for the change-of-variables principle in multivariate calculus, particularly in the study of multiple integrals. His work implicitly recognized that transforming coordinates in a multidimensional space alters how infinitesimal regions are measured. Although the formal concept of the Jacobian determinant had not yet been introduced, Lagrange already understood that variable transformations require a compensating correction factor to account for changes in local volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Significance\n",
        "This work represents the conceptual seed of what would later become the Jacobian determinant. The notion that coordinate transformations require a principled adjustment of “volume” existed decades before the formal machinery was developed.\n",
